- 👋 Hi, I’m @meekflyer
- 👀 I’m interested in creating an open source application that amps up how we use "contact" tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift and SwiftUI for MacOS.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything yet, just learning how things work here.
- 📫 Reach me at meek@meekflyer.net!
